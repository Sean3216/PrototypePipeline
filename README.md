# PrototypePipeline
Pipeline to process data and select models from available options (currently XGBoost and Prophet) to do prediction/forecasting.

### Running the script
The pipeline can be executed with terminal by first navigating to the directory of the scripts and run main.py like the following command:

```shell
python main.py --config [config_dir]
```

Notice that we need to input the directory of the configuration file. Examples of configuration files are located in configs folder.
